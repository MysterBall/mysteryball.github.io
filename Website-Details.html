<h2 style="font-family:sans-serif"><center><u>Hello! Wanna find out about us? Read on.</u></center></h2>
<h3><u>How'd it begin?</u></h3>

<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Mr Mystery, at age five, wondered: 'How do these people make such great names; Gravity Falls, Men in Black, Knight Rider, etc? Let me think... Hm, Galaxy 15! MysteryBall! Yes, I'll write a book with pictures called: Galaxy 15!' So this Mr Mystery hand-wrote a book called Galaxy 15. From here, their imagination expanded, creating a story that went through generations for a lot of years. Then one day Mr M. decided to share this with the world, but the story was <i>too</i> long. Hence, Mr M. re-thought the entire continuity, and put it on this very website for the enjoyment of the sensible world.</p>

<h3><u>Mr Mystery</u></h3>

<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">This is an interesting topic... Where too start? Well, he's the founder. The man-with-the-plan. Heck, he's the very one writing about himself in third person. <i>I</i> am Mr M. I illustrates this comic and art that you love. He (or I) write all them stuff you read on our website. Yeah, I run this whole show. Thanks.</p>
<br>
<h3><u>The Team</u></h3>
